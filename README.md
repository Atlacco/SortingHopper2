SortingHopper
=============

Bukkit plugin that creates item filter from a hopper.

Notes
=====

Modify the config.yml for specific control over program execution. The file also includes commentary on effects of configuration options. For ease, features are listed here:

* Can prevent items from being pulled from Sorting Hopper into other hoppers

* Can prevent dropped hoppers from being picked up

* Can forcibly alter block break event for Sorting Hoppers to alter the lore on drop (note: will not play nice with block break protection systems)

* Enables custom crafting recipe for the Sorting Hopper.
